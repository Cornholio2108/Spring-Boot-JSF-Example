Spring-Boot-JSF-Example
=======================

Looked around and saw on stack overflow that no one had a working example of JSF and Spring boot working together. So I added this example so that I could use it to answer some stack-overflow questions

To run use 

```
Windows:
gradlew run 

Other:
sh gradlew run
```

After that visit these 2 links

http://localhost:8080/test.xhtml //JSF page

and 

http://localhost:8080/greeting //Spring MVC Service

There was a common belief that because JSF and Spring MVC were their own view techs that they could not be used together, but this is incorrect and is part of this example
